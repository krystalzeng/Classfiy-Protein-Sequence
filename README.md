# Eukaryotic protein sequences classification

The aim of this project is to develop a method in order classify eukaryotic protein sequences into the 4 categories: Cytosolic, Secreted, Nuclear and Mitochondrial.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```
numpy==1.14.1
pandas==0.22.0
Keras==2.0.8
matplotlib==2.2.0
scikit_learn==0.19.1
biopython

```

### Running

```
Demo.py is the main demo file. This file shall save the confusion matrix for Uniform Model, Logistic Regression Model, and Random Forest Model. A 'result.txt' is generated to demonstrate the output prediction on the blind test set.
```
